        "The #SOLFUNMEME logo is a cosmic, psychedelic digital artwork. It centers on a glowing blue eye with a black pupil, surrounded by vibrant red, fractal petals and cream-colored mycelial tentacles tipped with glowing orbs. Above is a golden four-pointed star or cross, all set against a cosmic background fading from deep blues and greens to gold, dotted with spores and circuit-like swirls. The logo is a fusion of organic (fungal, floral, mycelium) and technological (circuit, AI) elements, symbolizing memetic infection, vision, and the spread of ideas. See all details and the mathematical transformation formula at: https://codeberg.org/introspector/SOLFUNMEME/issues/123"

Each iteration boosts key traits like the red claws and mycelium. This captures the evolution, recursion, and viral spread of the meme.
